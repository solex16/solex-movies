# TMDB Movie project for Zone Digital

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## The app has been deployed to:
[My personal server](http://robertfranks.net/tmdb/)
## Or: Run on localhost
Download the repo, then in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Notes
The functionality has been completed according to [Zone Digital Spec](https://zone.github.io/frontend/movie-listing)

Styling may be a little too 'playful' (esp. with the 'random' header background colours)

### Shortfalls
No tests are set up

No accessibility

### To Do
Get more results and paginate

Improve layout, expecially breakpoints for grid columns
